# Shell Environment Configuration

To keep me sane.  You want me sane.

## Usage

From your home directory:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mkenney/.dotfiles.git && ./.dotfiles/init.sh
```

Warning: This will overwrite conflicting existing dotfiles in your home directory without warning, take a look at the [`init.sh`](https://github.com/mkenney/.dotfiles/blob/master/init.sh#L50-L64) script.
