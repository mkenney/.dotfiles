# Shell Environment Configuration

To keep me sane.  You want me sane.  Believe me.

## Usage

From your home directory:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mkenney/.dotfiles.git && ./.dotfiles/init.sh
```

Warning: This will overwrite conflicting existing dotfiles in your home directory, look at the `init.sh` script

## ToDo

Add `zsh` support and configurations
